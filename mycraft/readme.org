** some questions

   - [ ] to understand the source code of some implementation from =spacemacs=

    emacs -Q --load init.el
  #+end_src

** transient-state seems to be spaceamcs's own implementation
   https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c7a103a772d808101d7635ec10f292ab9202d9ee/layers/%2Bspacemacs/spacemacs-completion/packages.el#L137


** helpful

   #+begin_quote
   you can search for Emacs functions within Emacs by typing M-x apropos, then typing your query. In this case, M-x apropos <RET> whitespace <RET> provides a list of functions relating to whitespace.
   #+end_quote
