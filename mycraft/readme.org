* Configurations

  A literal programming for my own emacs configs.

* Start to build my own emacs

** things needed to be done or enahnced

   - [ ] add a alias key prefix for =SPC m=
   - [ ] change the look of flycheck hint
   - [ ] It's time to check whether there is anything needed to be improved for the workflow

** program relavant config

   - [X] add python virtualenv detector
   - [X] javascript lsp, eval
   - [ ] emacs-lisp, lisp configuration (lispy?)
   - [ ] manage this config by literate programming way
   - [ ] ssh remote better ux https://github.com/jixiuf/vterm-toggle
   - [ ] k8s editor mode https://github.com/TxGVNN/emacs-k8s-mode/blob/master/k8s-mode.el

** some questions

   - [X] to understand the source code of some implementation from =spacemacs=
   - [ ] what is =featurep=
   - [ ] what does the =command= in the use-package do


  #+begin_src bash
    emacs -Q --load init.el
  #+end_src

** use =esup= to profiling the emacs start up time

** transient-state seems to be spaceamcs's own implementation
   https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c7a103a772d808101d7635ec10f292ab9202d9ee/layers/%2Bspacemacs/spacemacs-completion/packages.el#L137

** helpful

   #+begin_quote
   you can search for Emacs functions within Emacs by typing M-x apropos, then typing your query. In this case, M-x apropos <RET> whitespace <RET> provides a list of functions relating to whitespace.
   #+end_quote

*** introspec the keybinding in the emacs
