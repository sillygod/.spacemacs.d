* Configurations

  A literal programming for my own emacs configs.

* Start to build my own emacs

  Wow almost complete :)

** things needed to be done or enahnced

   - [ ] add a alias key prefix for =SPC m=
   - [ ] change the look of flycheck hint
   - [ ] It's time to check whether there is anything needed to be improved for the workflow
   - [ ] add rename file function
   - [ ] understand the lisp macro
   - [ ] diminish persp workspace in the modeline

** program relavant config

   - [X] add python virtualenv detector
   - [X] javascript lsp, eval
   - [ ] ssh remote better ux https://github.com/jixiuf/vterm-toggle
   - [ ] k8s editor mode https://github.com/TxGVNN/emacs-k8s-mode/blob/master/k8s-mode.el
   - [ ] emacs-lisp, lisp configuration (lispy?)
   - [ ] refactor my config when the line number is above 2000
   - [ ] manage this config by literate programming way

** some questions

   - [X] to understand the source code of some implementation from =spacemacs=
   - [ ] what is =featurep=
   - [ ] what does the =command= in the use-package do


  #+begin_src bash
    emacs -Q --load init.el
  #+end_src

** use =esup= to profiling the emacs start up time

** transient-state seems to be spaceamcs's own implementation

** helpful

   #+begin_quote
   you can search for Emacs functions within Emacs by typing M-x apropos, then typing your query. In this case, M-x apropos <RET> whitespace <RET> provides a list of functions relating to whitespace.
   #+end_quote
