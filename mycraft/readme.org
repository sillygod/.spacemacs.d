* Configurations

  A literal programming for my own emacs configs.

** prerequisite

   #+begin_src sh
     curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daipeihust/im-select/master/install_mac.sh | sh
     brew install ispell
   #+end_src

* Start to build my own emacs

  Wow almost complete :)


** things needed to be done or enahnced

   - [ ] [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Bmisc/multiple-cursors/packages.el][integration for multiple cursor from spacemacs]]
   - [ ] add lookup function like doom emacs (which is based on counsel-search)
   - [ ] add run test and intergrate them into which-key bindings
   - [ ] add rename file function
   - [ ] add google dictionary function
   - [ ] adopt darkroom package?

** program relavant config

   - [ ] manage this config by literate programming way
   - [ ] ssh remote better ux https://github.com/jixiuf/vterm-toggle
   - [ ] k8s editor mode https://github.com/TxGVNN/emacs-k8s-mode/blob/master/k8s-mode.el

** better to have

   - [ ] a startup dashboard
   - [ ] interactive sql mode
   - [ ] spacemacs' org-doc-view mode?
   - [ ] https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa need this?
   - [ ] window management https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/ui/popup

** some questions

   - [X] to understand the source code of some implementation from =spacemacs=
   - [X] what does the =command= in the use-package do (make the command to be autoloaded)
   - [X] what is =featurep=


  #+begin_src bash
    emacs -Q --load init.el or
    /usr/local/opt/emacs-head@27/bin/emacs -Q --load init.el # a xwidget support version
  #+end_src

** use =esup= to profiling the emacs start up time

** use =what-cursor-position= to see the detail font-face under the cursor
   run this with universal args can get a more detail info.

** toggle-debug-on-error help to debug

** transient-state seems to be spaceamcs's own implementation

   [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/c7a103a772d808101d7635ec10f292ab9202d9ee/layers/%2Bspacemacs/spacemacs-completion/packages.el#L137][source code link]]

** helpful

   #+begin_quote
   you can search for Emacs functions within Emacs by typing M-x apropos, then typing your query. In this case, M-x apropos <RET> whitespace <RET> provides a list of functions relating to whitespace.
   #+end_quote

*** introspec the keybinding in the emacs
    https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/653/how-can-i-find-out-in-which-keymap-a-key-is-bound

** evil-collection

   Oh~ We can overwrite the original keymap by changing the kemap of the mode

   ex.
   #+begin_src elisp
     (setcdr
        (assq 'lispy-mode minor-mode-map-alist)
        lispy-mode-map)
   #+end_src

** some commands

*** list-colors-display
*** (load file nil (not init-file-debug))
    =load= will load repeatly when you call multiple times but =require= will only do once.
*** set vs setf vs setq

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (set ls '(1 2 3 4)) => Error - ls has no value
      (set 'ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK
      (setq ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - make ls to (quote ls) and then have the usual set
      (setf ls '(1 2 3 4)) => OK - same as setq so far BUT
      (setf (car ls) 10) => Makes ls '(10 2 3 4) - not duplicated by setq/set
    #+end_src
