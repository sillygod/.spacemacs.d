* Customize your spacemacs

Let's start to customize your spacemacs

* Install
  
Clone this repo to the =~/.emacs.d/private=

#+begin_src shell
git clone https://github.com/sillygod/spacemacs-private.git ~/.emacs.d/private
#+end_src

or you can clone to other position and then create a soft link to the directory.

* Description
  
This is an enhancement of my workflow with emacs

* Personal configuration

Currently, I preffer put configuration in the file =.spacemacs= instead of using my =config= layer.

* Reference
  
Here are some tutorials.
